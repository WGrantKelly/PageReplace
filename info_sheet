Additional comments to the grader:


I could not properly get a linked list together and simulate even the clock method.

I started with OPT and then had to comment out all of the code for it because it did not work quickly enough. It took about 5 minutes to do half of the memory accesses. 

I then moved on to a linked list OPT but have been getting weird segmentation faults that I have worked for hours on solving, unsuccessfully.

I am going to talk to Dr. Farnan about this project, but please let me know if there is anything extra I can do, because I have hit almost none of the rubric.

I want to do the write up, but there is no proper data for me to record.
